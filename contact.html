                <h4>Discover five easy yet powerful CSS techniques that can instantly improve the look and feel of your website—perfect for beginners who want to level up their styling game.</h4>
                <h3>When you're just starting out with web development, CSS can seem a bit overwhelming. But there are simple tricks that can make your websites look polished without complex code. Here are five CSS tips I wish I knew earlier:<br/>

                    Use a CSS Reset: Normalize browser styles using * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }. This ensures consistency across all browsers.<br/>
                    
                    Flexbox is Your Friend: Centering things has never been easier. Use display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; to center content both vertically and horizontally.<br/>
                    
                    Responsive Units: Instead of pixels, try em, rem, or % for better scalability on different screen sizes.<br/>
                    
                    Custom Fonts: Google Fonts makes it easy to integrate stylish fonts. A single line of HTML and a quick font-family rule can elevate your design.<br/>
                    
                    Hover Effects: Use :hover to add interactivity to buttons and links. Even simple color changes can make a UI feel dynamic.<br/>
                    
                    CSS gets better with practice—try these out on your next project and see the difference!<br/>

                <h4>A personal take on transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript, highlighting the benefits, challenges, and real-world improvements seen in coding workflow and app stability.</h4>
                <h3>JavaScript has been my go-to language for years, but after working on a few larger projects, I started noticing the cracks—bugs due to incorrect data types, unclear function parameters, and hard-to-maintain codebases.<br/>

                    That’s when I gave TypeScript a try. The transition wasn’t as hard as I thought, and here’s why I made the switch:<br/>
                    
                    Type Safety: Knowing exactly what data a function expects and returns has saved me from countless runtime errors.<br/>
                    
                    Better IDE Support: My editor now autocompletes like a dream, making coding much faster.<br/>
                    
                    Improved Documentation: Type annotations act as living documentation, which is especially helpful in team settings.<br/>
                    
                    Gradual Adoption: You don’t have to rewrite everything at once—TypeScript lets you start small and build from there.<br/>
                    
                    After 3 months with TypeScript, I honestly can’t imagine going back to plain JS for anything serious.<br/>

                <h4>A behind-the-scenes look at the process, tools, and time-saving strategies used to design and develop a personal portfolio site in just three days.<h4>
                    <h3>Building a personal portfolio doesn’t have to take weeks. I gave myself a 3-day challenge to go from zero to launch, and it worked! Here’s a breakdown of how I did it:<br/>

                        Day 1 – Planning & Design:<br/>
                        I sketched a wireframe on paper, selected a color scheme using Coolors, and picked a clean Google Font. I used Figma to do a quick digital layout.<br/>
                        
                        Day 2 – Development:<br/>
                        Using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, I started building. I used Flexbox for layout and made it responsive with media queries. The hardest part was making sure everything looked good on mobile.<br/>
                        
                        Day 3 – Content & Launch:<br/>
                        I wrote my bio, listed a few sample projects, and embedded a contact form. Then I hosted the site using GitHub Pages.<br/>
                        
                        The result isn’t perfect, but it’s live—and that’s what matters. Done is better than perfect<br/>
